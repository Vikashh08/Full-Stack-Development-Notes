## High-Level Language

### Meaning
A high-level language is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. You do **NOT** need to manage low-level system resources such as:
- Memory allocation
- CPU registers
- Hardware details

> *JavaScript handles these automatically.*

### Example
```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let sum = x + y;
```
*This is simple and readable compared to low-level languages.*

## Industry Perspective

- **Faster development**
- **Easier debugging**
- **Less complexity**
